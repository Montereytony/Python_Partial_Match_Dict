# Python_Partial_Match_Dict
This code reads colon seperated key:value pairs and creates a dictionary. 
The code is not disrupted by blank lines or by missing values. 
It also does a partial match on search terms and returns keys along with 
all values it matched.

Feel free to use and abuse the code.
